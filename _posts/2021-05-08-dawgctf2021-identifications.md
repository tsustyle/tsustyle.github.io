We're given two images. One of a **Verizon** storefront and one of a list of WiFi access points.

A couple of things stuck out about the WiFi points. `Carroll Counseling`, `Katanasushi` and `Carterque`

Apparently there's a *lot* of **Katana Sushji** joints, but **Carterques**? Not so much. Turns out, they're all within close proximity of each other in **Mt. Airy Maryland**

There's even a Dunkin Donuts right next door! (saw in street view)

Now all we have to do is find the **CLLI** code for **Verizon** in **Mt. Airy Maryland**
