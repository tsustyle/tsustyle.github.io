### Port Scanning and General Enumeration (Nmap)
* Reading/Resources
  * [Nmap manual](https://nmap.org/book/man.html)

Initial Nmap scan


![img](/assets/images/htb/delivery/1.png)

All ports


![img](/assets/images/htb/delivery/2.png)

Targeted scan on 8065


![img](/assets/images/htb/delivery/3.png)

Not much for initial scanning aside from the unknown port `8065`

The contact page of the website links us to `helpdesk.delivery.htb` and `delivery.htb:8065` which is a **Mattermost** server. Interesting.

### Access (Mattermost, SSH, OSTicket)
* Reading/Resources
  * [mattermost](https://mattermost.com/)
  * [OSTicket](https://osticket.com/)

The **OSTicket helpdesk** is what you think it would be. You can create and view tickets.

I got stuck here for a while trying to perform an XXS attack before I took a step back. 

First, let's keep this in mind:

Next, let's create a ticket:


![img](/assets/images/htb/delivery/7.png)

So, to access the **mattermost** server we need an `@delivery.htb` email address. It looks like the support center *gives* us an `@delivery.htb` email address, but we can't directly access it. Or can we?

> If you want to add more information to your ticket, just **email**

Does that mean we can use the support ticket *as* the email itself? Let's try by signing up for a **mattermost** account using our `@delivery.htb` email and checking the ticket.

Now we've got access to the **Mattermost** server!

Creds? They don't work on OSTicket or the Agent login.. but..

They do for ssh!

### Privesc (linpeas, mysql, hashcat, rsmangler)
* Reading/Resources
  * [linpeas](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite)
  * [mysql cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/mysql)
  * [hashcat cheatsheet](https://github.com/frizb/Hashcat-Cheatsheet)
  * [rsmangler](https://github.com/digininja/RSMangler)

Let's do some enumeration!

Running linpeas we see:


![img](/assets/images/htb/delivery/12.png)

The **mattermost** user is running **mattermost** located in the **opt** directory. Checking out the config file:


![img](/assets/images/htb/delivery/13.png)

mysql creds?

`mysql -u mmuser -p` with the password `Crack_The_MM_Admin_PW`

Let's roll through `mysql`

1. `show databases;`


![img](/assets/images/htb/delivery/14.png)

2. `use mattermost;`
3. `show tables;`


![img](/assets/images/htb/delivery/15.png)

4. `show columns in Users;`
5. `select Username, Password from Users;`


![img](/assets/images/htb/delivery/16.png)

Hashes!

The entry on the **mattermost** server mentions **PleaseSubscribe!**, **hashcat** and hashcat rules so we can safely assume that this hash, once cracked, will be a variation of **PleaseSubscribe!**

``` 
PleaseSubscribe! may not be in RockYou but if any hacker manages to get our hashes, they can use hashcat rules to easily crack all variations of common words or phrases.
```

I tried cracking it using different rules, but couldn't manage it. I ended up using **rsmangler** to mutate **PleaseSubscribe!**

`hashcat --force -m3200 --status -w3 -o found.txt --remove --potfile-disable hash newlist `
