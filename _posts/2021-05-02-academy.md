### Port Scanning and general enumeration (Nmap, FFuF)
* Reading/Resources
  * [Nmap manual](https://nmap.org/book/man.html)
  * [FFuF](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf)

Webserver and something to do with mysql on that high port. Let's enumerate the webserver

Browsing using the url, gives us an error pointing to `academy.htb`. Adding the url and `academy.htb` to our hosts file fixes the error.

We have the ability to **LOGIN** and **REGISTER**. After registering and logging in we're greeted with a `home.php` page that is seemingly the **HTB Academy**, but nothing works! Well, we know that the site is built on `php` so let's toss a `FFuF` at it fuzzing for `.php` files

admin page??

Requires credentials that we don't have. 

### Access (BurpSuite, metasploit)
* Reading/Resources
  * [BurpSuite](https://portswigger.net/burp)
  * [metasploit](https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/getting-started)

Let's go back and take a closer look at the registration process by capturing the request in `BurpSuite`

Interesting parameter. `roleid`? Let's change that to `1` and send it off. What happens if we try to use this new account with the `roleid` of `1` to log into the admin section?

We're in! Let's add `dev-staging-01.academy.htb` to our hosts and navigate to it.

Error page, but lots of information here. Looks like `database` usernames and passwords. App name is `Laravel` and even the app key! I couldn't find a version number for `Laravel`, but let's see if `metasploit` has anything for us

Lookg good. Outside of the ordinary options it requires the `APP_KEY` (that base64 string we found earlier) and the `VHOST` which in our case is `dev-staging-01.academy.htb`

Let's fire it off and get our shell.

### Privesc (linPEAS, Composer)
* Reading/Resources
  * [linPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/linPEAS)
  * [Composer GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/composer/#sudo)


Doing some manual enumeration on the box there are a couple things to note. First, there are *six* users with an interactivce shell.

And the `.env` file for `htb-academy-dev-01`, it had much of the same information from the error page we found earlier. But since it's basically a staging branch of the site, what if the original `academy` site has an `.env` file too?

I wonder if any of those six users is the database dev? Maybe they reuse passwords?

Trying that password with each user until I found that the password works for the `cry0l1t3` user


![img](/assets/images/hackthebox/academy/10.png)

So now we're `cry0l1t3`, what can we do?


![img](/assets/images/hackthebox/academy/11.png)

Turns out, not a lot. Let's run `linPEAS` and see if there are any privesc vectors we can use

Oh? Some horizontal movement? Well, `mrb3n`, what can *you* do?

Hey, this user can actually sudo. Checking `GTFOBins` we find
