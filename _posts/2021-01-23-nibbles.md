### Port Scanning and General Enumeration (Nmap, Gobuster)
* Reading/Resources
  * [Nmap manual](https://nmap.org/book/man.html)
  * [Gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster)

Initial scan shows ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP)

The website just says hello world but the source has something interesting

Powered by **Nibbleblog**

Let's see if we can uncover anything with **gobuster**

Bunch of interesting stuff.

README has the version


![img](/assets/images/htb/nibbles/5.png)

admin.php is the login page

And there's a `/content/` directory with a `users.xml` file

### Things we know:
- It's running **Nibbleblog**
- The version is **4.0.3**
- There's an **admin** user
- There's a **login** page

### Access (Burpsuite, php-reverse-shell, CVE-2015-6967, cewl)
* Reading/Resources
  * [Burpsuite](https://portswigger.net/burp)
  * [php-reverse-shell](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php)
  * [CVE-2015-6967](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/133425/NibbleBlog-4.0.3-Shell-Upload.html)
  * [cewl](https://tools.kali.org/password-attacks/cewl#:~:text=CeWL%20is%20a%20ruby%20app,such%20as%20John%20the%20Ripper.)

Let's start by targeting the **admin** user. As far as I could tell, Nibbleblog doesn't have default credentials so we can try to bruteforce it.

First, I like to create a wordlist based on the website. For this, we'll use **cewl**

`cewl -url http://10.10.10.75 --lowercase -w wordlist`

Capture the request in **Burpsuite** and send it to **intruder**

Load our newly created wordlist and fire it off.

We have the password and we can now access the dashboard.

Googling `Nibbleblog 4.0.3 exploits` lead me to [CVE-2015-6967](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/133425/NibbleBlog-4.0.3-Shell-Upload.html). 

We can upload a [php-reverse-shell](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php) using the `My Image` plugin, and access it using this endpoint:

`/nibbleblog/content/private/plugins/my_image/image.php`

Let's do that. Upload your image, start your listener `nc -lvnp 4444` and access the endpoint.

My favorite linux enumeration script is [linpeas](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/linPEAS) by far. 

After getting it on the box using `wget` and running, we get an interesting finding.

We can run `monitor.sh` as **root** without a password. Let's overwrite `monitor.sh`

`echo '#!/bin/bash' > monitor.sh`
`echo '/bin/bash' >> monitor.sh`
`sudo ./monitor.sh`
