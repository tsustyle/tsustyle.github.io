### Port Scanning and General Enumeration (Nmap)
* Reading/Resources
  * [Nmap manual](https://nmap.org/book/man.html)

Initial nmap scan shows 135,139,445,49152-3-4-5-6-7 open. So I targeted those ports in my targets scan.

Also ran a `--script=vuln` scan

### Access (metasploit, EternalBlue (ms17-010))
* Reading/Resources
  * [Metasploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/english/44040-the-easiest-metasploit-guide-you%E2%80%99ll-ever-read.pdf)
  * [EternalBlue (ms17-010)](https://www.cisecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Security-Primer-EternalBlue.pdf)


Knowing that the SMB version is vulnerable to **EternalBlue** and that the OS hasn't been patched (Windows 7 Professional SP1) we can use a metasploit module for access

`msfconsole`
`search ms17-010`

That was easy! Capture the flags.
