My name is Jay and I'm studying CyberSecurity with a focus on Red Team operations.<br><br>


I find that I'm able to retain information a little easier if I write it down as if I'm trying to teach someone how to do it.
So this is basically a culmination of all of my notes presented in a 'how-to' or 'teaching' format.<br><br>


As time goes on you'll be able to find things like Box and CTF Challenge Writeups, cheatsheets I've written for myself, projects I'm working on and even some articles on tools/concepts that I come across as I learn.<br><br>
