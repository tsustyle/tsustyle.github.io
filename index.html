My name is Jay and I'm studying CyberSecurity with a focus on Red Team operations.

I find that I'm able to retain information a little easier if I write it down as if I'm trying to teach someone how to do it.
So this is basically a culmination of all of my notes presented in a 'how-to' or 'teaching' format.
As time goes on you'll be able to find things like Box and CTF Challenge Writeups, cheatsheets I've written for mysel, projects I'm working on and even some articles on tools/concepts that I come across as I learn.

Feel free to contact me on Twitter!
